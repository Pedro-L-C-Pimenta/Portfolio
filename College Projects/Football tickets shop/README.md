# Football tickets selector
## Objective 
This was an open group project I did for Object oriented programing (MC302) in Unicamp. 

## Description
Our team realy like football (the true one, not the american football) so we decided to make an application to buy tickes for the games and based on the stadium it will occur you be able to select the sector you want

The whole project was done using Java in Eclipse IDE

We don't finished 100% because we didn't had the time as all members was doing a lot of subjects and some extracurriculars
