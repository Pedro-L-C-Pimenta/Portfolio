# Portfolio
Salve, I'm Pedro Pimenta, a Computer engeneering student in UNICAMP (Universidade Estadual de Campinas)  

I've been doing some projects for college and doing self-coordenated projects for studing some languages and IDEs since I got into Unicamp, so after 4 years of study I've decided to create this repository to be a compilation of all that projects I've done and also the futures ones, basicaly a Portfolio.

As you may guessed I'm from Brasil, thus some of my codes will be commented in portugueses, mainly the old ones done before the idea of doing this portfolio
